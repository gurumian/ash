2. Select "SSH" as connection type
3. Enter host, port, username, and password
4. Click "Connect"

### Serial Port Connections
1. Click "New Session" or use `Cmd/Ctrl + N`
2. Select "Serial" as connection type
3. Choose serial port from dropdown
4. Configure baud rate and other settings
5. Click "Connect"

### Logging
1. **Start Logging**: Click the ⏺ (record) button in the terminal header
2. **Stop Logging**: Click the ⏹ (stop) button
3. **Save Log**: Click the 💾 (save) button to manually save current buffer
4. **Clear Log**: Click the 🗑 (trash) button to clear current log data

Logs are automatically saved to `~/ash-logs/` with timestamped filenames.

### Session Manager

- **Toggle Visibility**: Use `View > Appearance > Toggle Session Manager`
- **Switch Sessions**: Click on session tabs or use keyboard shortcuts

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Xterm.js
- **Backend**: Electron (Node.js)
- **SSH**: ssh2 library
- **Serial**: serialport library
- **Styling**: CSS3 with modern features

### Key Components
- `src/main.js`: Electron main process with IPC handlers
- `src/App.jsx`: React frontend with terminal management
- `src/preload.js`: Secure IPC bridge
- `src/App.css`: Modern UI styling

### Logging System
The logging system uses a buffered approach for memory efficiency:

1. **Buffer Management**: Data is collected in memory buffers
2. **Automatic Flushing**: Buffers are flushed when they reach 100 lines or 10KB
3. **File Storage**: Logs are saved to `~/ash-logs/` with session-specific filenames
4. **Real-time Updates**: UI shows current logging status and controls

## File Structure
```
ash/
├── src/
│   ├── main.js          # Electron main process
│   ├── App.jsx          # React frontend
│   ├── App.css          # Styling
│   ├── preload.js       # IPC bridge
│   └── renderer.jsx     # Renderer entry point
├── assets/              # Icons and resources
├── forge.config.js      # Electron Forge configuration
└── package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Cmd/Ctrl + N`: New session
- `Cmd/Ctrl + W`: Close current session
- `Cmd/Ctrl + T`: Toggle session manager
- `Tab`: Switch between sessions

## Log File Format
Logs are saved as plain text files with the following naming convention:
```
~/ash-logs/
├── SSH_Session_2024-01-15T10-30-45-123Z.log
├── Serial_Device_2024-01-15T10-35-20-456Z.log
└── ...
```

Each log file includes:
- Timestamp markers for session start/stop
- All terminal input and output
- Connection status changes
- Session metadata

## Development

### Project Structure
The application follows a modular architecture:

- **Main Process**: Handles system-level operations (SSH, Serial, file I/O)
- **Renderer Process**: Manages UI and user interactions
- **Preload Script**: Secure communication bridge between processes

### Adding New Features
1. Add IPC handlers in `main.js`
2. Expose APIs in `preload.js`
3. Implement UI in `App.jsx`
4. Add styling in `App.css`

### Debugging
- Use `npm run start` for development mode
- Check browser DevTools for renderer process debugging
- Check main process logs in terminal
